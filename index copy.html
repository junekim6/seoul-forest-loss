      <p class="body-text serif">On most weekends, Kim Jin-Tae, a retired high school English teacher in Seoul, South Korea, can be found exploring the lush forests that dot the city. At 63 years old, Kim has been a devoted hiker for more than four decades.</p>

      <p class="body-text serif">"I don’t quite understand myself why I am so drawn by forests,” he said when asked about the allure of hiking. “All I know is that as soon I enter a forest, I just feel good. Nothing else feels the same way.”</p>

      <p class="body-text serif">Kim is one of the millions of people in Seoul who love to spend time in the city’s rich green spaces. According to a survey from 2021, seven out of ten residents visited a forest at least once a month. </p>

      <p class="body-text serif">The availability of forests plays a big role in Korean’s love for hiking. Two-thirds of South Korea is covered by forests, making it one of the top countries in the world for forest coverage. Despite being a densely populated city of 10 million, a quarter of Seoul's land is also forested, offering residents a glimpse of tree-covered mountain ranges amidst the cityscape. The language itself reflects the ubiquitous and intimate connection the Korean people have with forests. The common Korean word "뒷산," meaning "the forest behind the home," encapsulates the affection and sense of ownership the people have for the forests in their neighborhoods.</p>

      </script>
    </div>

      <p class="body-text serif">Despite the deeply ingrained cultural significance, Seoul's cherished forests are facing an alarming decline without a clear sign of recovery. This trend, which started over five decades ago, is only being exacerbated by the rampant construction of new housing developments. The incessant pressure to increase housing supply has driven politicians, developers, and landowners to transform the foothills of forests into high-rise apartments with a view. Conservationists and forest management experts fear that the benefits of city forests are not receiving enough attention or protection.</p>
