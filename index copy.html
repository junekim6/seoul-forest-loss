      <p class="body-text serif">On most weekends, Kim Jin-Tae, a retired high school English teacher in Seoul, South Korea, can be found exploring the lush forests that dot the city. At 63 years old, Kim has been a devoted hiker for more than four decades.</p>

      <p class="body-text serif">"I don’t quite understand myself why I am so drawn by forests,” he said when asked about the allure of hiking. “All I know is that as soon I enter a forest, I just feel good. Nothing else feels the same way.”</p>

      <p class="body-text serif">Kim is one of the millions of people in Seoul who love to spend time in the city’s rich green spaces. According to <a href="https://www.si.re.kr/node/66150" target="_blank">a survey from 2021</a>, seven out of ten residents visited a forest at least once a month. </p>

      <p class="body-text serif">The availability of forests plays a big role in Korean’s love for hiking. Two-thirds of South Korea is covered by forests, making it one of the top countries in the world for forest coverage. Despite being a densely populated city of 10 million, a quarter of Seoul's land is also forested, offering residents a glimpse of tree-covered mountain ranges amidst the cityscape.</p> 
      
      <p class="body-text serif">The Korean language itself reflects the ubiquitous and intimate connection the people have with forests. The common Korean word "뒷산," meaning "the forest behind the home," encapsulates the affection and sense of ownership the people have for the forests in their neighborhoods.</p>

      </div>

      <p class="body-text serif">Despite the deeply ingrained cultural significance, Seoul's cherished forests are facing an alarming decline without a clear sign of recovery. This trend, which started over five decades ago, is only being exacerbated by the rampant construction of new housing developments.</p>
      
      <p class="body-text serif">The incessant pressure to increase housing supply has driven politicians, developers, and landowners to transform the foothills of forests into high-rise apartments with a view. Conservationists and forest management experts fear that the benefits of city forests are not receiving enough attention or protection.</p>


      <h3 class="section-head">New housing development is a main driver of deforestation</h3>

      <p class="body-text serif">The data from Korea Forest Service shows that Seoul has lost more than 5,500 hectares of forest area since 1965, a staggering loss of an area equivalent to 16 times of Central Park in New York City.</p>

      <p class="body-text serif">In 2022, researchers from The Seoul Institute surveyed experts on what they believed were the key drivers of deforestation in Seoul. Two-thirds of the respondents cited housing development projects as the main cause. While farming and various non-residential building projects also made the list, they were minimal compared to housing development.</p>

      <p class="body-text serif">Han Bong-Ho, a professor at the University of Seoul School of Landscape Architecture, explained that the health of Seoul’s forests is intimately linked to the city’s real estate and housing policy.</p>

      <p class="body-text serif">“For the past several years, the government’s top priority has been to increase the housing supply as much as possible to tame the soaring housing prices,” Han explained. “This resulted in extensive housing development in previously protected areas, especially in the outskirts of Seoul.”</p>

      <div class="chart-section">
        <iframe title="Just Keep Building" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-jSyoK" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/jSyoK/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="300" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
        </script>
      </div>    

      <p class="body-text serif">In a densely populated city like Seoul, it is unsurprising that housing prices are often on people’s minds. In recent years, the issue has become increasingly urgent as prices skyrocketed to new heights. In 2021, <a href="https://m.khan.co.kr/national/national-general/article/202101010600055" target="_blank">a survey by Kyung Hyang Daily</a> revealed that housing prices were the top social issue South Koreans were concerned about.</p>

      <p class="body-text serif">While increasing supply is an essential part of housing affordability, Han believes that the real estate market has turned into a reckless profit-driven machine. “Profit from the real estate business is at the center of all this new development project,” he said. “Politicians, land owners, and developers are hyper-focused on maximizing the returns on these projects.”</p>

      <p class="body-text serif">The development surge has dramatically transformed many areas of Seoul’s landscape. The city outskirts, once characterized by low-rise residential buildings, are now dotted with towering skyscrapers that are a recent addition.</p>

    <section class="story-body" style="margin-top: 18px;">

      <p class="body-text serif">Part of the problem stems from the fact that the Seoul city government does not have the structural and legal authority to safeguard its forests, ​​which fall under the jurisdiction of the national government. The Korea Forest Service, a division of the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (MAFRA), is responsible for preserving the country's forests.</p>

      <p class="body-text serif">According to Han, "Seoul views its green spaces primarily as parks, not forests. They have the obligation to ensure public safety and enjoyment, but their responsibilities end there."</p>


      <h3 class="section-head">City forests: public good on private lands</h3>
      
      <p class="body-text serif">However, the impact of forests extends far beyond recreational spaces. They have a vital role in enhancing the quality of life in indirect ways, as numerous studies have proven. Trees improve air quality and provide relief from high temperatures during scorching days. Nevertheless, these benefits are frequently disregarded.</p>

      <blockquote style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
        <p><q>Without a revamp of housing policy and a curb on rising home prices, I don't believe we will see a meaningful improvement in protecting our forests.</q></p>
        <footer>Han Bong-ho, Professor at University of Seoul.</footer>
      </blockquote>

      <p class="body-text serif">Han said there was a clear tension between private land ownership and the public good that forests bring to the city. Landowners can often generate profit by transforming forest lands into residential developments, even if it means sacrificing the public’s interests. “Without a revamp of housing policy and a curb on rising home prices, I don't believe we will see a meaningful improvement in protecting our forests.”</p>

      <p class="body-text serif">In a city filled with shopping malls and posh coffee shops but not enough public spaces, forests serve as gathering places where people can socialize without having to spend money. It is where relationships and friendships are often formed.</p>

      <p class="body-text serif">Kim recounted how he first fell in love with hiking in his 20s. “I was one of those young folks who disliked hiking. I found it to be boring and tiresome.” That perception shifted when he grew close to a forest-loving friend from church.</p>

      <p class="body-text serif">“I started hiking to keep him company and to spend time with him. We would talk while we hiked, for hours.” Slowly, he started to discover the magic of forests. One could never do the same hike twice, he said. “Even if you visit the same forest dozens of times, it is never once the same. The leaves, the trails, the weather… The forest is ever changing. You can not get tired of it.”</p>

      <p class="body-text serif">As residents of Seoul face the consequences of poor air quality and extreme heat due to climate change, the importance of city forests for the health and well-being of the city is slowly being acknowledged.</p>

      <p class="body-text serif">“We are only now starting to understand the intangible but significant benefits forests bring to the city,” Han said. “But we still have long ways to go.”</p>
